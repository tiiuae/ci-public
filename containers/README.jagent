Custom configuration can be done in confs/jenkins_agent.local
See confs/jenkins_agent.default for the values that can be adjusted.

To create jenkins agent container:
./build_jenkins_agent.sh [uid=current uid] [gid=current gid]
The uid and the gid of the jenkins user inside the container
should be such that they have write permissions to the external
persistent store.

External store gets initialized at the first container run.
Store directory should not exist beforehand.
./run_jenkins_agent.sh [persistent store=./jagent]

Running the container currently ends to running a shell
inside the container. One can stop the container simply
by exiting that shell by 'exit' command.

 ----

For upload to the agent to work, one needs to place public key
for a connection from control to the cache directory as
{CACHE}/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys
