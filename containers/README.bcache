 Binarycache container
 ---------------------

Custom configuration can be done in confs/bcache.local
See confs/bcache.default for the values that can be adjusted.

To create binarycache container:
./build_bcache.sh

To run container:
./buid_bcache.sh [cache directory]

First run (cache-directory not existing) initializes the system.

 ----

For upload to binarycache to work, one needs to place public key
for a connection from hydra to the cache directory as
{CACHE}/home/.ssh/authorized_keys
